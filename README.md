## Twitter wordcloud creation in R for the hashtag: PAIC2014

This repo provides an R script that can create a wordcloud in the statistics package, R.  I have saved the Tweets in a CSV file, so this script can be amended to save you the hassle of creating a Twitter dev account and getting the API key and secret, which is required for the first steps
